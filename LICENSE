SQueaL License 1.0

-   Do with this software as you wish.  Make money, link to your executable, fork and hack your own version, etc.

-   I don't need credit. No need to provide a copy of SQueaL's license. However, the current version of 
    SQueaL does use libdrizzle, distributed under GPLv2 (shameful), so you will need to adhere to that portion 
    the software based on that license for the time being.  Use of this library isn't a permenant solution, and
    once this project is stable, it's removal is the highest priority.
    
-   While not a requirement, I'd appreciate giving back to this project. If you enhance/extend functionality
    that may be used by others, consider contributing your work upstream.
